# ðŸš€ Personal Video Box
This is a JAVA DApp which allows users to upload a video.

The video is stored in a decentralised storage(IPFS for now) which means it cannot be deleted or censored.
The reference(the video file hash) to the video is stored on the blockchain(Ethereum for now).
Use cases:
- User uploads a video to the website via the UI.
- The video gets uploaded to a storage.
- Storage service generates a hash file.
- The system then stores the hash of the video file to a Blockchain(Eth in this case)
- The hash can then be retrieved using user's wallet credentials and can display the saved video on the website.
